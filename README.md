## Notes:
  1. The screenshots above are only few examples on how the application works, not all endpoints and functionnalities were tested.
  2. All functionnalities are related to the Auth middleware, which means that the user must be authenticated before being able to perform anything
  3. this is only a part of a big project which backend was implemented previously using Django, but now I decided to switch to Nodejs for more advanced features and better runtime, you'll find the other repo of the django backend in my Github account, and the react app will be found in another one.
  4. you'll find in my Github account a repo which contains the habit tracker frontend, before you use that app, please clone the repo of Habit tracker api (the django version), the frontend is currently related to the django backend not this one.


### I hope you found this helpful, any feedback is welcomed.
